# Ionic 3 roles client
This application is the client part of a demo that implements and shows the authentication and roles management in a Ionic 3 application.
The application manags a todo list, that is stored in a remote database an can be seen by the users, and modified by the creators and the editors.
Only the editors can delete the todos.

Is hosted in: [http://ionic3-roles-client.herokuapp.com](http://ionic3-roles-client.herokuapp.com)

The demo can be executed like any other Ionic application, using the Ionic CLI command: `ionic serve` to execute it in development mode.

### Configuration
The server URL in the providers must be defined in order to make the application work (uses a fake direction).
